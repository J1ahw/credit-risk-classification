# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Analyst Report

The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit risk for peer-to-peer lending through the use of machine learning.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:

  * Accuracy: 92%

  * Precision:

    * Healthy Loans- 1.00
    * High-Risk Loans- 0.85
  * Recall:

    * Healthy Loans- 0.99
    * High-Risk Loans- 0.91
* Machine Learning Model 2:

  * Accuracy: 92%

  * Precision:

    * Healthy Loans- 1.00
    * High-Risk Loans- 0.84
  * Recall:

    * Healthy Loans- 0.99
    * High-Risk Loans- 0.99

# Summary
I would recommand model 2 because it has higher recall than model one, with both the same accurary, 92%. Both predict well on health loan, so I perfer model two which can predict high-risk loan better.
