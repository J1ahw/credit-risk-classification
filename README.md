# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Analyst Report

The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit risk for peer-to-peer lending through the use of machine learning.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.
